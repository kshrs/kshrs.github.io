            <main class="blog-content">
                <p>Blogging has always fascinated me since my childhood, but I have never really taken it seriously. I grew up using GNU/Linux and reading HowTo blogs, GitHub READMEs and dev posts have been a part of me.<br><br>

                But now, the purpose of this blogging journey is to document my ML Research journey and general learnings. Inspired by <em>@neuralpat(X.com), @BorisMeinardus(X.com, YouTube)</em>, I have decided to test whether writing blogs actually helps the overall learning and understanding process. [ actually his youtube video added confidence to my idea of starting a blog <a href="https://youtu.be/NTe3VKUNouE?si=aGhaEvji9DORH_Sf">Video: Why Everyone Studying AI Should Create Content</a> ]</p>
                <p>My blogs will be solely focused on three main things(but not limited to):</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li>To document my overall learning and journey in life.</li>
                    <li>To learn ML Research Concepts with more clarity by writing about it, as if teaching someone. The Feynman Technique</li>
                    <li>To improve my focus on learning and being accountable in the overall journey. <em>The Grind Mindset</em></li>
                </ul>

                <p>As the ML Research part has more value/importance, I am gonna focus more on that. <br><br>

                Right now, I have decided to focus more on pursuing a ML Research Career than to focus on general academics. No matter what stops me(academics). <br><br>

                Hope this blog post stays as a reminder to focus on my journey and not on the distractions.<br><br>


                The grind culture made me understand that I have stayed with the wrong group of people and actually wasted a year doing nothing. So time to fix this shit rn.<br><br>
                So gotta go and start working.
