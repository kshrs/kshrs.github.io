				<h3>Why LinkedIn Is Fucked Up!</h3>
				<h5>LinkedIn is no different from the other big tech social platforms.</h5>

				<p>There was a time when people walked building to building for interviews, waiting days for email replies. Now we scroll an app called LinkedIn — a platform once meant to connect with like-minded professionals and get job offers through casual chats.</p>

				<p>In the beginning, the idea was clean. You’d post your accomplishments, list your qualifications, add some experience, and build a resume-like profile. It worked. People liked it. Recruiters used it, job seekers benefited. It grew fast - 10 million users in 4 years.</p>

				<p>But what do I see now when I open LinkedIn?</p>

				<p>Promotional content, viral posts, cheat sheets, random course notes, ads for certifications, and motivational quotes telling me to “work harder.”<br>Why do I need motivational quotes on a job platform?</p>

				<p>Now it feels more like Facebook - post-driven, follower-hungry, with content made to grab attention, not help. I’ve seen people spend so much time watching and congratulating others, while doing nothing for themselves - yet they still feel like they've achieved something.</p>

				<p>The human touch is lost, AI writes about their achievements and experience, collaboration has turned into content marketing, achievements and gratitude turned into likes.</p>
				<p>LinkedIn was meant to be a place to share research, projects, achievements and experience. But now it is just a regular marketplace with free dopamine of information about others's success.</p>

				<p><h5>Piece of advice:</h5> Use LinkedIn the way it was supposed to be.</p>
				<p><em>LinkedIn was built for work. Now it is just another distraction.</em></p>
